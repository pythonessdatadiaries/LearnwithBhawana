Email Alias Generator ðŸ“§ 

This is a beginner-friendly Python project to help users create smart and unique email aliases based on the purpose of the emailâ€”such as job applications, newsletters, freelance work, personal use, or business.

Features âœ… 
	- Generates an email alias based on your name, purpose, and domain.
	- Adds a relevant keyword depending on your selected email purpose.
	- Gives you the choice to add:
	- a random number
	- a custom number or no number at all
	- Helps you create a professional or fun alias based on your need.

How It Worksâœ… 
	- You run the program via main.py, which interacts with the user.
	- It takes user inputs and passes them to generate_alias() (from email_alias_generator.py).
	- generate_alias() selects a relevant keyword and connector, and constructs the final alias in this format:

name + connector + keyword + number (optional) + @domain
Example: bhawanasaxenacv@yahoo.com

Code Structure ðŸ›  
	1.	main.py
This file handles user interaction (input/output). Itâ€™s the entry point of the project and keeps logic separate from the core alias generation logic, which is best practice in real-world coding.
It:
	- Displays domain choices
	- Takes user input
	- Validates the input
	- Calls the generate_alias() function with user data
 
	2.	email_alias_generator.py
Contains the function generate_alias():
	- Cleans and formats the name
	- Selects a keyword from a predefined list based on the emailâ€™s purpose
	- Optionally adds a number
	- Constructs the email alias

Sample Scenario : 
Welcome to Email Alias Generator!
Enter your name: Sam
What is this email for ?(job,newsletter,freelance,personal,business): newsletter

Available domains:
- gmail.com
- yahoo.com
- outlook.com
- hotmail.com

enter your preferred domain without @ : yahoo.com
Do you want to include a number in your email?(yes/no): yes
do you want to add number manually?(yes/no): yes
Enter the number: 098

Your smart email alias is:
sam-subscribe098@yahoo.com

Why Separate main.py?

In Python, separating the logic (in email_alias_generator.py) from the script that interacts with the user (main.py) follows modular programming. This helps:
	â€¢	Reuse the logic in other apps (like a web or mobile app)
	â€¢	Keep code organized and readable
	â€¢	Easier to test or expand later
