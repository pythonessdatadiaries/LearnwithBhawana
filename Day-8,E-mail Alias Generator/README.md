Features ✅ 
	•	Generates an email alias based on your name, purpose, and domain.
	•	Adds a relevant keyword depending on your selected email purpose.
	•	Gives you the choice to add:
	•	a random number
	•	a custom number
	•	or no number at all
	•	Helps you create a professional or fun alias based on your need.

How It Works✅ 
	•	You run the program via main.py, which interacts with the user.
	•	It takes user inputs and passes them to generate_alias() (from email_alias_generator.py).
	•	generate_alias() selects a relevant keyword and connector, and constructs the final alias in this format:

name + connector + keyword + number (optional) + @domain
Example: bhawanasaxenacv@yahoo.com

Code Structure 🛠 
	1.	main.py
This file handles user interaction (input/output). It’s the entry point of the project and keeps logic separate from the core alias generation logic, which is best practice in real-world coding.
It:
	•	Displays domain choices
	•	Takes user input
	•	Validates the input
	•	Calls the generate_alias() function with user data
	2.	email_alias_generator.py
Contains the function generate_alias():
	•	Cleans and formats the name
	•	Selects a keyword from a predefined list based on the email’s purpose
	•	Optionally adds a number
	•	Constructs the email alias

Why Separate main.py?

In Python, separating the logic (in email_alias_generator.py) from the script that interacts with the user (main.py) follows modular programming. This helps:
	•	Reuse the logic in other apps (like a web or mobile app)
	•	Keep code organized and readable
	•	Easier to test or expand later
