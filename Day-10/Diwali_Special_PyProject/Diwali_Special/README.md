## 🧩 Project Structure

| `templates/` | Folder containing all HTML templates (`index.html`, `diyas.html`, `recipes.html`, `wishes.html`, `base.html`). |
| `static/` | Folder for images like `diya.jpg` and other static assets (CSS, icons, etc.). |

Would you like me to add a **“Try it yourself” section** with small code snippets (e.g., how to add a new route or render a new template) — to make the README even more helpful for beginners browsing your GitHub?
