## 🧩 Project Structure

| File / Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `app.py` | The **main Flask application** that connects all pages — Home, Diyas, Recipes, and Wishes. It handles routes, user form submissions, and calls templates for rendering content. |
| `test_app.py` | A **testing script** to check if the Flask app runs correctly — great for beginners to learn how to test Flask apps easily. |

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install flask
python app.py(windows)
python3 app.py(mac/linux)

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

	•	test_app.py helps you practice basic testing in Python for web apps.
	•	Each HTML file is simple and easy to modify for your own festive theme!

Would you like me to add a **“Try it yourself” section** with small code snippets (e.g., how to add a new route or render a new template) — to make the README even more helpful for beginners browsing your GitHub?
