## üß† What is Recursion?

> A function calling itself to solve smaller chunks of a problem.

```python
def say_hello(n):
    if n == 0:
        print("Stop")
    print("Hello")
    say_hello(n-1)
```

What is Stack Overflow?‚ö†Ô∏è 

Recursion without a stop (base case) leads to memory overload.

```python
def call_me():
    return call_me()
```

call_me()  #  Will crash: RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded


Memoization to the RescueüöÄ 

Memoization stores results of expensive function calls and returns cached result when the same inputs occur again.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
```
üìå @lru_cache helps us avoid recalculating the same results.
