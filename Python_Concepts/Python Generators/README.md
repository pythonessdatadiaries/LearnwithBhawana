# 🐍 Python Generators: Beginner Guide + Interview Prep

Welcome to the fun zone of Python Generators!  
If you're a **first-timer**, this guide (plus the attached PDF) will help you understand generators with ease — and prep you like a pro for your next interview.

## What are Python Generators?

Generators are special functions that **yield** values **one at a time**, instead of returning them all at once.

💡 Think of them as:
> "Functions on a diet — they don’t hog memory and give you just what you need!"

---

## 🧠 Why Use Generators?

✅ Memory efficient (great for large data)  
✅ Lazy evaluation (values generated on the fly)  
✅ Cleaner code with loops  
✅ Perfect for interview coding rounds!

## ✍️ Syntax Example:

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for value in my_generator():
    print(value)
```
