# Working with JSON in Python: A Beginner's Guide

As a beginner, it's important to learn about JSON.

# Why Learn JSON in Python?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data format in web development, AI, and data science. Knowing how to work with JSON in Python is essential for:

- API interactions: JSON is a common data format used in API requests and responses.
- AI applications: JSON is used to store and exchange data between AI models and other applications.
- Configuration files: JSON is often used to store configuration data in a human-readable format.
