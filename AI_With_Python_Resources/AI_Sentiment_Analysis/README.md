A beginner-friendly Python project to analyze product reviews using simple rule-based sentiment analysis.

⸻

## 📂 Project Files

This project contains the following files:
	1.	sentiment_analysis.ipynb
→ Open this file in Jupyter Notebook to run the complete project.
	2.	sentiment_data.csv
→ This CSV file contains the input product reviews.
→ Make sure this file is in the same folder as the notebook.


## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Open Jupyter Notebook
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Then open sentiment_analysis.ipynb inside the browser.

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

The notebook automatically loads the CSV using:
```
df = pd.read_csv("sentiment_data.csv")
```
No changes needed — just ensure the CSV is present.


### Step 3: Run Cells One by One

	•	Sentiment classification logic
	•	Final output DataFrame
	•	Exported results CSV

	•	Working with DataFrames
	•	Writing functions
	•	Exporting results to a CSV

**Perfect for beginners entering Python + Data Science!**

###  Output File📤

The notebook also generates:
```
sentiment_output.csv
```

This contains all reviews and their predicted sentiments.
